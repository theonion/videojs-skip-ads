videojs-skip-ads
=====================

# Usage

```
var player = videojs('my-player-id', {});
player.skipAds({});
```
	
## Options

`delayInSeconds`: How many seconds after preroll starts before you want to allow skip.  Default is 5.

```
player.skipAds({ delayInSeconds: 10 }); // Example
```
	
`skip`: Disable ability to skip preroll but still display informational overlay.  Default is true, e.g. allow skipping

```
player.skipAds({ skip: false }); // Example
```

## Styling

Have left styling up to implementers.  The markup below can be positioned wherever within the player.  The `videojs-ads-info` div will have a class of `enabled` during ad playback.  The skip button will have a class of `enabled` whenever skipping is allowed.

```
<div class="videojs-ads-info enabled">
	<span>Your video will resume in 23 seconds</span>
	<a class="enabled">Skip Ad</a>
</div>
```
